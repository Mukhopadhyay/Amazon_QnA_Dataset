## Description:
This dataset contains Question and Answer data from Amazon, totaling around 1.4 million answered questions. The data were collected and made available by [Prof. Julian McAuley](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/) of [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/) (University of San Diego)<be>

## Acknowledgements
This data was acquired from Prof. Julian's website. Different categories of data were present in independent archive files (each question being a separate `JSON` file in the archive). I joined them and added the attribute `Category` for ease of use. Please go through the ICDM paper, in particular, it goes into great detail on the potential of this dataset. That was one of my major inspirations for creating this dataset.
